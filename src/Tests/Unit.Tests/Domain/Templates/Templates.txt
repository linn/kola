1. A template is a special container that serves as the root of a component tree

2. A component is an abstract type that represents something a user can use to compose templates.  All components have parameters 

3. Concrete component types include:
   - atom (a childless node)
   - container (a node with children)
   - widget (a user-defined composite component, like a subtree.  Can include special 'placeholder' components(?) where other content can be added once placed in a template)

4. A page is an instance of a template.  It is composed of component instances, where all parameter values have been resolved for the current context.  The component tree includes all of the components specified in any referenced widgets.
